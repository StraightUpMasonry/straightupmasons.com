My name is Leo Fehrenbacker. I’m founder of Straight Up Masonry and I’ve been a mason for over 20 years.

> “I learned the trade back when I was just a kid living in the panhandle of Idaho, with a wife, 2 babies in diapers and not a soul around.”

I had gotten a job at the union, working as a laborer in a paper mill. I was a young hungry kid so naturally all the trades wanted me to come work with them.

### I wasn't sure what to do…

So I called my dad and he said:

> “Masonry is in your blood.”

That kind of stuck in my head. (My great grandfather was a stonemason in Germany.)

When I talked to my foreman a couple days later, I told him I was thinking about masonry and he looked me right in the eye and said…

> “I’ve never known a good mason to go hungry”.

So I picked it up and never looked back. That was over 20 years ago, and I’ve never gone hungry.

### I started my own company with some partners about 15 years ago.

I had just moved to southern Utah and that went well for years but ended up going belly up during the recession.

Then about 2 years ago I started straight up masonry.

### We are religious about quality.

I’m always preaching quality in the tooling, quality in the brushing, quality in the laying. I tell my guys “I sell the best block walls in town, therefore we have to lay the best block walls in town”

> "I’m confident that I am the best mason around so I only work with the best."

### Straight Up Masonry is different from most other masonry companies.

We recognize that building a wall around your yard is different than working on a commercial job site.

When you're working around someone's home it requires special care to make sure you don’t leave things in shambles. So we really pride ourselves in how we take care of your yard while we're there.

Masonry is a hard job, and we're hard men but we go out of our way to make sure that your happy.

It’s my goal that every homeowner I work with can shake my hand after the job is done and say “pleasure working with you”.
