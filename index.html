			<p class="editable">We’ll contact you within 24 hours of applying for a quote to set up a time when we can drop by and take measurements. Quoting a project usually takes under 30 minutes and we’ll give you a price, go over possible timelines and discuss any special requirements for your job. We'll also send you an official estimate via email after we leave.</p>

			<h2 class="editable">2. Course Work</h2>
			<p class="editable">The first thing we do when starting a project is check with Blue Stakes to make sure we don’t dig up any underground power, gas or anything else. Then we bring in the Mini-X to dig your footings followed by a compactor to make sure you have a solid foundation. Next we pour concrete, including plenty of rebar and finally put in the first course of block into the wet concrete.</p>

			<p class="editable">This is where we bring in the noise (figuratively speaking) me and the boys come in and throw your wall up. If we have a project wet, set and stalked there aren't many residential walls we can’t put all the way up in a day or two.</p>
